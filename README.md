# dsi_india_miss_data

The code in the repository is used to prepare the figures and results in the "Missing Feature Data Report",
summarizing work and exploration done to investigate the robustness of machine learning models used for PM2.5 
prediction (on currently simulated data from GEOS-Chem) to missing data patterns found in real life.

## Instructions


Results obtained:
Missing data % under various regriddings as well as raw
Time series for AOD under different samplings as location
Visualization of missing data %
AutoML performance on untouched data
AutoML performance on all regriddings
AutoML performance for select regriddings and droppped features

First, run
